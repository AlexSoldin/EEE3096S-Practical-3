# EEE3096S-Practical-3
This practical focused on the design of a modified version of a binary clock using a Pi and interfacing with the RTC using I2C.

This practical deals with the creation of a more complex binary clock by interfacing with the RTC using I2C, allowing the Pi to hold the system time correctly.
Two buttons, that utilise interrupts and debouncing, will be connected and will have the following functions: Button 1 fetches the hours value from the RTC, increments it by one and writes back to the RTC. Button 2 fetches the minute value from the RTC, increments it by one and writes back to the RTC.
The circuit schematic is attached showing the hardware setup.
